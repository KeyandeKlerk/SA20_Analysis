Buttler is interested in the review. <strong>They have reviewed</strong>. A very subtle signal from buttler, not a proud T normally seen. Looks like the ball hit the top of the back pad before hitting bat. Length ball just outside off, Impact three-fourth of the way up middle. <strong>It's hitting! Fortune favours Fortuin.</strong> Resigned smile from Pretorius who has to walk back. Royals are chuffed, excellent review. It came in, looked like spin. Pretorius was stuck in his crease and couldn't account for the angle in, he was trying to dab it late with an open face towards short third. Got hit on the pad before it hit bat.",

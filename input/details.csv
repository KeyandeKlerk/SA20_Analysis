Super Kings are through to the semi-final while MI Cape Town are coming off a nerve-jangling affair that they lost by the barest of margins against Pretoria Capitals. MI Cape Town will be looking to sign off from the tournament on a high and take away some positives from this season. The air is buzzing in Johannesburg and the Wanderers Stadium is buzzing. Flags waving and the atmosphere is electric! It's sunny, gorgeous and there is no chance of rain</p><p>Faf du Plessis, who is ageing like fine wine, hogged the limelight once again at the Wanderers to guide Super Kings into the SA20 semi-finals. The former South Africa captain rollicked to 92 off 61 deliveries that got his side to 160/6 in the last match. Reeza Hendricks looks in fine touch as well; he played the supporting role by scoring 40 runs. Kings' bowling unit is a well-oiled machine with Maheesh Theekshana and Gerald Coetzee conjuring up wickets at crucial junctures of the game. Also, the new kid on the block, Kyle Simmons wreaked havoc on Sunriser's middle order, returning brilliant figures of 3/23 in the last game. </p><p>On the other hand, Rashid Khan bowled his heart out and only conceded 17 runs in his spell to keep his team in the hunt but Pretoria Capitals prevailed in the thriller on Saturday evening. The veteran Rassie van der Dussen had earlier set the platform with his brisk 51 but he didn't get much help from his teammates which hurt their cause. One of the bright spots for Cape Town has been the teenage sensation Dewald Brevis who plays with an uninhibited approach and it will be exciting to see how he fares in this game.</p>",

Joburg Super Kings register an emphatic win over MI Cape Town, winning by 76 runs!",,"<p>Faf du Plessis: I was thinking how do you play that ball, the arm-ball and half-tracker that should have been dispatched for four. Probably hit a patch and spun, the only ball that did that in the whole game. The powerplay is important, you could see the way that Wade played, the intensity, the way he played those laps, good options for him. du Plooy is having a great time, such maturity for such a young guy. It is not an old-school Jo'Burg wicket. It would have been great to have had a home semifinal but we are switching venues. A bowler's graveyard there so we have to change our plans and come back.</p><p>Leus du Plooy, Player of the Match: It was tough to time it the whole innings. Luckily we had a chance to play on it yesterday and we got to a good total. I asked him if it was outside off and I'm sure he (Wade) will get me a beer later. It is a fantastic tournament to be a part of, a fantastic environment to be a part of with a captain like Faf and a coach like Fleming who has won so many IPL titles. I'm gonna keep improving and learning.</p><p>Rashid Khan: The way we started with the ball we were under control but in the middle, we did not execute our plans. We gave runs and those runs cost us. It was not a wicket of 190. Something to learn and next time is going to be much better. Overall if you look into this competition, we did not take the game deep and with the batting we haven't scored enough. In the last 10 games, we have scored just two-three fifties. 120 is a lot of balls to play and that's something to look into. When it was time for us to score runs, we lost wickets. I absolutely loved it, every stadium is packed and how successful this competition is. I feel after IPL this is gonna be a massive competition and the second-best league.</p><p>Joburg Super Kings register a clinical win over MI Cape Town and they barely put a foot wrong tonight putting up an above-par 189 on the board thanks to Leus du Plooy's onslaught - which was one for the memory vault - as he hit 11 fours and one maximum, striking at 168.75 for his blistering 81-run-knock. Thereon, Matthew Wade's counter-attacking, brave, nimble-footed 40 off 18 balls coupled with handy contributions from the lower order got them to a competitive total. </p><p>Even though George Linde got Faf du Plessis out on the very first delivery, JSK didn't stray from their plans and kept going hard at MICT bowlers. Reeza Hendricks departed early in the piece as well but the run-rate didn't drop. In reply, MI Cape Town batters got starts but couldn't convert them into substantial scores as the bowling from JSK remained spot on with rare looseners. The spinners - Maheesh Theekshana and Kyle Simmons - spun a web around the batters, not allowing them to tee off and picked up wickets whenever batters were getting some semblance of control. As a result of well-knit bowling performance, JSK were always in the driver's seat and the game never seemed slipping away from them. </p><p>And that conludes live coverage of this game. Until next time, it's goodbye from me (Rvel Zahid) and Ranjith.</p>"

Literally what the doctor ordered. Teams wise, Super Kings' batting has been bolstered by Matthew Wade. Shepherd can hit big but he is a bowling allrounder at No. 7. Sunrisers on paper, have seven bowling bowling options with Smuts and Markram. Adam Rossington is in form which is a positive for them with the bat.</p><p><strong>Aiden Markram, Sunrisers captain</strong> were going to bowl, so they're happy with it. Doesn't think it'll change too much, and hopes to restrict Super Kings and chase it down later. He says the ground is unique, most grounds in South Africa are different. Says Wanderers generally offers pace and bounce but has taken spin in the last two years, so they've done homework on the conditions and ultimately play the game out in the middle. Says they want to play a great game and gain confidence and momentum. <strong>One change</strong>: Fuller is back for Ottneil Baartman.</p><p><strong>Faf du Plessis, Super Kings captain</strong> says the track is a bit dry, hopes it'll slow down as the cracks open up. Says the weather looks alright. The team is in a good position but they don't want to be complacent having played played two good games. <strong>Same team as the last game</strong>. </p><p><strong>1:02pm</strong>: Super Kings win the toss and bat</p><p>Both teams had washouts in different cities a couple of days ago but it's a <a href=""https://twitter.com/SA20_League/status/1622177499038846976"">balmy day in Joburg</a>.</p><p><strong>12:45pm</strong>: It's Sunrisers Eastern Cape's final game in the group stage of the season. They sit comfortably at No. 2 on the <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sa20-2022-23-1335268/points-table-standings"">Points Table</a> and will look to head into the semis on a positive note. For Joburg Super Giants, there's a game today and tomorrow and they are likely to reach the semis thanks to Durban Super Giants' poor net run rate and four fewer points having played one extra game. But Super Kings wouldn't like to allow Super Giants an outside chance to qualify. Given that context, let's find out how these two teams go against each other. Toss coming soon. Stay tuned.</p>",

Utterly stunning from du Plessis, an innings made all the more extraordinary by the struggle at the other end, where Reeza Hendricks was batting at a tempo four times slower than his skipper. He eventually redeemed his strike-rate towards the end of their hefty 157-run stand, but his departure was some justice for Durban's bowlers. Mayers was effective up top and Topley bowled superbly and without luck. But the rest proved slim pickings.</p><p>So, a very important win for Joburg, who have<a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sa20-2022-23-1335268/joburg-super-kings-vs-durban-s-super-giants-22nd-match-1343962/points-table-standings> brought themselves back into the chasing pack</A>, on 16 points.

I am Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens today in this potentially fascinating contest. </p><p>Both teams come into this game having won their most recent encounter. While the Royals got the better of table-toppers Pretoria Capitals on Sunday, the Sunrisers routed Durban's Super Giants by 124 runs on the same day. The Sunrisers, in fact, have won four of their last five matches and could solidify second spot with another victory today. The Royals, meanwhile, currently sit third on the <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sa20-2022-23-1335268/sunrisers-eastern-cape-vs-paarl-royals-21st-match-1343961/points-table-standings"">points table</a> and would want to go level with the Sunrisers (at the very least; a bonus point will take them above today's opponents). </p><p>So, there is plenty riding on this contest. Both teams, including today, have only three fixtures left, meaning that they have to be on their toes and ensure that they are still part of the knockout phase when it comes along. Lots of stars on display too, and despite this contest being staged in the afternoon, there should be enough star quality in the game to keep you glued to your television screens.</p>",

Miller, however, kept his cool at the end and did what he does best - finish off the game. </p><p>The Sunrisers, meanwhile, would be left ruing what could have been had they put up more runs on the board. Their bowling plans, especially in the 18th over, also left a bit to be desired, considering Magala kept venturing into Miller's arc.

Goodbye, goodnight and take care! </p><p><strong>9:14pm</strong> A fairly comfortable victory for the Capitals in the end. MI Cape Town never really got going and the only time they looked to be in the contest in the second innings was when Brevis was at the crease. Once the youngster departed, van der Dussen could not take up the mantle and his 25-ball 24 did their chances more harm than good. The rest of the middle order also looked thin, and with the likes of Nortje and Parnell firing on all cylinders, MI Cape Town were, quite frankly, blown away. </p><p>Parnell also deserves plenty of praise for how he handled his resources. The gamble to bring Jacks on worked a charm, as did the ploy to persist with Rashid, despite him conceding 18 runs in his opening over. The Capitals, in short, won all the moments that mattered tonight and now sit comfortably atop the points table.</p>"

The vibe was unbelievable and the band brings a different vibe. Just hitting my areas and lucky it's one of those nights when everything goes your way. I still enjoy playing the team game. I'd like to do it for a few more years and see how it lasts. Fortunate to play in front of this crowd at Gqeberha.""</p><p><b>Aiden Markram</b>: ""We struggled to package a full game till today. Conditions yesterday were tough. It was a bit of learning and couple of meetings this morning we discussed about combating it. When a guy gives you a good start in powerplay, it's easier. Confident squad at the moment, but we have to restart come Tuesday. It is a big game, they are a great side. It will be another wicket and we will have to reassess it. The Bull Dog showed it. His passion rubs off and he does not look his age and hopefully carries on for ten more years.""</p><p><b>8:59pm</b> Gqeberha is painted Orange! And the brass band has had its time. And so have the others who have thronged St George's Park tonight. It has been a dominating performance from Sunrisers tonight that gives them the bonus point. Rossington set it up with his blitz at the top. Van der Merwe once again reminded South Africa of the good old times with his passion and six-for. All in all, a clinical outing for the home side.</p><p>Lots to reflect upon for Super Giants. How could they have done better with the ball? Both pace and spin travelled for them. And then their batting crumbled on the face of a tall ask. Moreover, why did de Kock slide down the order and not push Mayers down if indeed such a move was needed. Impacts their NRR as well.

We lost the momentum in the last few overs. We tried to keep the things simple. We had a bad start but 140 was a good total here. And then a brilliant all-round effort by the bowlers. [On van der Dussen] He kept the innings till the end, it's good for us that he got runs under his belt. [On Linde] He has done an amazing job for us. You can send him up the batting order, can bowl him anywhere. Makes my job a lot easier. I felt whatever total we put up, the bowling unit we have, we can defend any total. Today we have shown that. It was a crucial win for us.</p><p><B>Jos Buttler</b>: Very disappointed. We are in a position where we thought we were really in the game. Facing Jofra is always a big challenge. It's great for the England team to have him back. It's not the easiest to hit boundaries here but that's the challenge of playing at different surfaces. We had a discussion that we could chase 40-45 in the last four overs but then Davey got out. We both are disappointed with the result.</p><p><b>Jos Buttler is the Player of the Match</b>, some consolation for him.</p><p><b>David Miller:</b> I think 142 was a competitive total on this wicket. But I thought they were still below par but losing a couple of wickets in the powerplay didn't help. It was difficult to score boundaries at will. Buttler and I kept ourselves in but then I got out. A bit disappointed. But it's not all doom and gloom. We would like to string a few more partnerships. A quick turnaround tomorrow and hopefully we can pull it with the bat.</p><p>Time for the presentation ceremony.</p><p><b>5.00pm</b> A superb defence from MI Cape Town; they pick up 4 points from the game to go No. 2 on the points table for the moment. Rashid Khan led from the front, going only for 16 - all singles - from his four overs. But before him, it was Linde who picked up two early wickets to rock Royals. Buttler and Miller anchored the chase. Miller fell for 26 but Buttler took them close. When Archer dropped him off Rabada, it seemed he might pull it off for Royals but Archer made amends by having him caught behind in the penultimate over to all but seal the win.

Jos Buttler fell early after a couple of false shots before Jason Roy departed to a wild slog. Wihan Lubbe was cleaned up by Carse for 28 while Morgan and Miller came and went.

They would also want to ensure that they capitalize on clutch moments in the game, having been guilty of withering away the advantage yesterday. The Super Kings, on the other hand, would hope that their batting resurgence continues today and that they can give their bowlers something to defend, especially if they bat first against a potent Capitals bowling unit. </p><p>Plenty to look forward to, as always.

Rossouw also continued in a similar vein, with Salt ensuring that there were no further hiccups. The Super Kings looked out of sorts in both departments and after the high of yesterday's win, they have come crashing back down to earth and have plenty to ponder moving ahead.</p>"

I am Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens tonight in this potentially defining clash.</p><p>It is still early days in the tournament but with the Super Kings having already lost twice (in three games), the onus is on them to turn things around. Their batting has been a real concern so far. Even in the match that they won, they were saved by a heroic Donovan Ferreira display. Collectively, they have been found wanting and against a strong Pretoria Capitals bowling attack, their resolve, technique and character will be tested to the hilt. </p><p>As for the Capitals, well, they are the only team with a spotless record this season. They have won both of their fixtures and have looked a dominant outfit. Phil Salt and Will Jacks have been superb at the top of the order. Their middle and lower order has also stood up when required and their bowling, especially on true batting tracks, has done enough to keep the opposition in check.

<p><strong>4:30pm</strong>: The weekend is over but worry not, cricket followers, the new week will load up with full-throttle action. The SA20, which started last week, has had great fanfare, conditions, and performances. Sunrisers Eastern Cape have had two losses chasing, they were off track early but had late flourishes which denied oppositions bonus points. They will look to turn things around and get their first-ever win. MI Cape Town have bookended a loss with two convincing wins, they have Kagiso Rabada and Jofra Archer, who was rested last game, in the mix. Dewald Brevis, the star at the top, could be on his way to the <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/south-africas-dewald-brevis-might-get-warner-like-introduction-to-international-cricket-1354219"">South African team</a>.

For now, it's me, Ekanth, signing off on behalf of my co-commentator, Ashish Pant, and our scorer, Venkat Raghav.</p><p><strong>Aiden Markram, POTM and Sunrisers captain</strong>: Made it tough for ourselves but will make us happy which is important. I was gutten when out. Lot to learn and take away personally. Hats off to Jansen and Stubbs for clearing it. I get nervous watching from the side, knowing you can't make an impact. Certainly pleased now. Bowlers did a great job. Their margins of errors have been small, restricting MI under 160 was great. More of the same, I suppose. If we get the small things right, it will help us going forward.</p><p><strong>Rashid Khan, MI Cape Town</strong>: It was close. I feel we were 15-20 short. But the way we bowled made me feel we were in till the end. It was a great performance, with the ball and in the field. It was a matter of going either side at the end. I feel we did a wonderful job. There are a few things to think about. It's important for us to move on, everyone knows their responsibility, enjoy, be mentally strong and give 100%.</p><p>The evening today started with cloud cover. The pitch was assisting the pacers, Cape Town understood they had to hit the pitch. Odean got it right, so did Rabada. They were outdone in parts by the batters but they were persistent. </p><p>The chase started with two early wickets. Curran got Rossington, a soft first-ball dismissal, and then got Smuts LBW. Erwee foiled with Aiden Markram who put up an aesthetic shot-making exhibition not devoid of power. I hope to have dreams of that cover drive he lofted into the outfield off Rabada. Rashid tried to shuffle his bowlers, tried to shake-up his act too. Got Erwee out to end a 92-run stand. Then Odean came on, got Markram for 50, trapped out Cox on review. The seesaw was in Cape Town's favour but Stubbs stood up tall. Got them on the verge of the win before Fuller finished it off.</p><p><strong>9pm</strong>: Cracker of a game. Markram and Stubbs finding form are huge plusses for Sunrisers. MI Cape Town showed their mettle, fighting back from multiple difficult situations, taking it to the last over.</p>"

MI Cape Town have won a game and lost the second match but it's still early days in the tournament and there are surely going to be many ups and downs as the inaugural edition of the SA20 progresses. MI Cape Town were clinical in the tournament opener against Paarl Royals where they registered a domineering win by eight wickets, chasing an untaxing 143 without any fuss as Brevis led the carnage with the bat and helped the side bag the bonus point as well whereas Archer made a resounding comeback to competitive cricket and took three wickets in his searing spell while Olly Stone was miserly as well. </p><p>Come the second match against Durban's Super Giants, MI Cape Town lost the momentum during their batting in the middle overs and they couldn't press on the accelerator, ending up with 152 on the board. Archer and Rashid Khan were a tad expensive as well. On the other hand, Joburg Super Kings started off their tournament in style by overpowering Durban's Super Giants by 16 runs after a well-knit bowling display that helped them get over the line. Donovan Ferreira went all guns blazing with an unbeaten 82 off 40 deliveries while Romario Shepherd's blitzkrieg helped them post 190 on the board. However, they looked a completely different outfit in their second game against Paarl Royals as they folded out for 81 which didn't perturb Royals as they cruised to an easy victory, chasing the total with 57 balls to spare.</p><p>Kagiso Rabada and Odean Smith have been included in the side and Jofra Archer and Olly Stone are rested for this game</p>",

The spinners kept getting wickets and made things easy for us. Lovely to play at Newlands, the crowd has been fantastic, and almost every game has been a sell-out. I wish I could make bowling look as easy as Joff (Archer), Olly Stone was slightly unlucky to have missed out today.</p><p>Rashid Khan, MI Cape Town captain: Amazing game, the way we bowled, KG, Linde and Waqar - it's a good win for us. We have played together in a Test match for Afghanistan, he (Waqar) has done well in the past and has the ability, he's ready to go and do well, happy for him. He had control in the middle overs. Linde, the way he bowled in the batting powerplay was superb, he and KG set the platform for us. It's not easy to bowl three overs in the powerplay for a spinner, but he always wanted to do it for us. I think we have the best bowling unit and so many options. We also have depth in the batting line-up, we saw it in the last game, it's just a matter of time before they step up and take the responsibility. The crowd has been great, they have come out to support us in large numbers over three games.</p><p>Faf du Plessis, Joburg Super Kings: T20 cricket is like a lottery, you can ride the momentum at times, two bad days, we will have to go back to Joburg and start over again. It could be a matter of confidence, you have three games in four days and it could be enough time to go back and work out. The pitch was slow and slightly worn out, their three spinners were certainly perfect for the conditions. We didn't have that luxury with our main spinner, Maheesh Theekshana, expected only later this week, would have been nice to win two on the road, but it's good to be going back home.</p><p>It was a walk-in-the-park affair for MI Cape Town as they register a comprehensive win over Joburg Super Kings. 107 was never really going to pose a serious challenge but this was a tricky and slow surface with the ball holding up and not coming nicely onto the bat. Brevis continued his rich vein of form and scored a quickfire 42 and Sam Curran's bright and breezy 15 made sure MI Cape Town get their second win of the SAT20. Earlier, George Linde and Rashid Khan didn't let Giants get off the hook and enjoyed bowling in spin-conducive conditions but it was Kagiso Rabada who hogged the limelight with his brilliant spell in which he only conceded 12 runs and picked up the vital scalp of Reeza Hendricks. The left-arm wrist-spinner Waqar Salamkheil spun a web around JSK as he took a leaf out of his captain Rashid Khan's book and made life arduous for the batters right from the get-go</p><p>That's it from tonight's coverage of the SA20.

Adil Rashid's control and willingness to toss it up brought mixed results. Neesham and Bosch chipped in. Nortje got decent control and was pacy as usual.</p>"

I am Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens tonight. </p><p>MI Cape Town come into this game very high on confidence, having convincingly dispatched the challenge of the Paarl Royals in their opening fixture. Their star-studded bowling unit fired, as did Dewald Brevis with the bat. On paper, too, they have one of the strongest squads and would be hoping to build on that momentum tonight. </p><p>The Super Giants, meanwhile, had their moments against the Joburg Super Kings. They reduced them to 27-4, only to wither away the initiative and allow the Super Kings an avenue back into the game. With the bat, Quinton de Kock was at his belligerent best, stitching together a brilliant opening partnership. Apart from that, however, not a lot stood out, and that is what they would be hoping to rectify against MI Cape Town.</p>",

I have played here quite a bit and I kind of understood the situation we were dealt with. (On batting second) I think the wickets will be a little slower in the day and they will come on a bit better in the night. (On the bonus point) We lost a couple of wickets and then concentrated on the win. Klaasen has been around a long time and in the end, we had to settle for just the win. </p><p><strong>Kyle Mayers, Player of the Match:</strong> It was a good feeling to get the team across the finish line. (On the delivery to bowl Brevis) That is something I practice. My team always backs me to pick up a wicket in the first over and when a plan comes together, it feels good. I have a bit of skill and I try to show it every now and then. (Contest with Archer) Last time I batted against him in a match was probably in school. First time I batted against him since he has started playing for England. I really enjoyed the first game in Durban and it is really good for South African cricket (that fans are turning up)</p><p><strong>Rashid Khan, MI Cape Town captain:</strong> We played good cricket in the last part of the first innings to put up that score. It was a matter of those 20-25 runs and that would have made the difference. The way the guys bowled and came back was a positive for us. Coming back tomorrow and we will hopefully not make the mistakes we did today. Whenever he (Stone) has been given an opportunity, he has stepped up. So good to have him and he has been amazing for us. </p><p>Time for the presentation! </p><p><strong>8:51pm</strong> Well, Paul finished that in quite a hurry towards the end. But for a brief period, it looked like the Super Giants' boat was wobbling. Barring that spell, though, they were very good in the run-chase. Mayers set the tone at the top, with Klaasen and Mulder carrying on that momentum. Holder was his usual composed self in the middle, and was complemented beautifully by Paul, who grabbed the bull by the horns and tilted the game his team's way. </p><p>Plenty to ponder, meanwhile, for MI Cape Town. They would be looking at their batting display in particular and how they lost the initiative in the middle overs. Archer was also uncharacteristically expensive, as was Rashid and that, considering they were only defending 152, came back to haunt them.</p>"

Super Kings have a few top order issues to solve, and that might involve Faf du Plessis going back to the opening spot. That's it from this game, but we are done yet. Not long before MI Cape Town take on Durban's Super Giants and Shashwat Kumar has fired up <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sa20-2022-23-1335268/mi-cape-town-vs-durban-s-super-giants-5th-match-1343945/live-cricket-score"">the comms</a>. I am signing off, though. Have a good evening, everyone. Ciao!</p><p><b>David Miller: </b> Coming back from the loss, but the guys were up for it, and they got to a great start. They were clinical in the backend. To get the bonus point was great. Thought of giving an extra over to Lungi. We were ahead of the game, and wanted to put the pressure on. We had the bowlers to sort the death bowling. There are always decisions that are 50-50. It is about trusting our instincts. It is about committing your instincts, and the bowlers helped us. [On the chase] We never discussed anything. Eighty is a niggly total. The guys know their roles, and we got to a good start. </p><p><b>Bjorn Fortuin is the Player of the Match: </b>Pretty special; our last game wasn't ideal, we had to bounce back and we did that. [Opening the bowling] It is quite high-risk, high-reward. It does present opportunities to pick wickets. The conditions played into our hands and we made good use of it today. </p><p>First up, <b>Faf du Plessis</b>: Disappointed with the start, that's stating the obvious. There was nice pace, and the bowlers got the ball to come through nicely early. The conditions got better in the second innings, but the score was way lower. Assessing the wickets is the most important thing, but it is about giving us a bit more time. We have not done it two games in a row. There were a few soft dismissals, but I think, we need to buck up. [On going at the top of the order] Just felt maybe Janneman needs an opening spot more than I do. It's something we have scratched our heads long enough, and we might go back. </p><p>Time for presentation. </p><p><b>4.12pm</b> Paarl Royals had conceded a bonus point in their opening game, they make sure they get on board with one. Top performance from them. A win that was thoroughly set up by the bowlers, who blew Super Kings for 81. The batters then, led by Jos Buttler, came out all guns firing to make light work of the chase. Jason Roy fell early, but Wihan Lubbe and Buttler kept them going. David Miller then came out, smashed a six to get to 9000 T20 runs before Buttler sealed the win by seven wickets.</p>"

I'm rooting for Stubbs to go big today"" -- Both teams can hold their own, although I would say that the Capitals look slightly better balanced. A bowling unit comprising of Little, Nortje, Parnell and Adil Rashid will be tough to get away on most days. de Bruyn, Jacks, Rossouw, Salt and Mendis (whenever he is available) make up a pretty good batting line-up too. </p><p>The SA20 has gotten off to a brilliant start, with fans flocking the stadium and enjoying plenty of excellent cricket. Yesterday, Donovan Ferreira lit up the competition with a splendid knock, only for Quinton de Kock to almost better it. In the end, though, the Joburg Super Kings did just enough to hold their nerve. A couple of days ago, MI Cape Town flexed their muscles against the Paarl Royals. So, today, both teams have an opportunity to lay down a marker of their own and tell the rest of the competition that they mean business. </p><p>Markram will lead the Sunrisers, and Parnell will captain the Capitals. A bit of history there, with Markram leading South Africa to the U-19 World Cup title in the past and Parnell falling at the final hurdle against Virat Kohli's boys all those years ago. Nevertheless, this is a new chapter for both teams and individuals, and with the quality on display, both would be disappointed if they can't get their campaign off to the perfect start. </p><p><strong>4:35pm</strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of Match 3 of the inaugural edition of the SA20 between the Pretoria Capitals and the Sunrisers Eastern Cape.

They produced a superb batting effort, which was then backed up by an equally impressive bowling display. Nortje, in particular, breathed fire throughout his spell and caused the Sunrisers all sorts of problems with his sheer pace. The hosts could have batted better but take nothing away from what was a clinical bowling performance. </p><p>Speaking of the Sunrisers, well, they would be largely unhappy with how this game panned out. Apart from Smuts' fifty, and a brief rear-guard action by Abell, Fuller and Stubbs, there was not much to shout home about. This could, in all likelihood, be their strongest eleven too, meaning that they will have to figure out a way to make better use of their resources moving forward.</p>"

I am Shashwat Kumar and akin to yesterday, will bring to you all the updates from what promises to be an exciting encounter. </p><p>Part of why I say that is because of the presence of excellent players on both sides. The Super Kings will be led by Faf du Plessis, who continues aging like fine wine. Alzarri Joseph, Janneman Malan, Kyle Verreynne, Lewis Gregory and Romario Shepherd are also part of the side. Durban, meanwhile, will be captained by Quinton de Kock, with the likes of Heinrich Klaasen, Jason Holder and Johnson Charles adding muscle and firepower to their batting unit. In Dwaine Pretorius, they also have a wonderful death-bowling option up their sleeve. </p><p>Apart from that, both teams would also be eager to match the early gauntlet MI Cape Town laid down yesterday. An opening game defeat usually does not define how a campaign will transpire, although it is an occasion that neither teams wants to pass up either.</p>",

Till then, this is me (Shashwat) signing off on behalf of M Venkat Raghav. Goodbye, goodnight and take care!</p><p><strong>9:10pm</strong> Wow, that was some game. It ebbed and flowed throughout but just when it mattered, the Super Kings held their nerve. They produced a superb death-bowling display, which ultimately proved to be the difference between the two sides, considering the Super Giants shipped 91 runs in their last six overs. The visitors' spinners also rose to the occasion, conceding only 79 runs in the 12 overs that they bowled, including a couple of crucial wickets. </p><p>There was plenty of batting class on display too. de Kock nearly turbocharged an improbable run-chase. Unfortunately for the hosts, none of the batters apart from Mayers provided de Kock the sort of support he needed. That was in stark contrast to how the Super Kings batters joined hands with Ferreira earlier in the evening, ensuring that they posted a total that was ultimately beyond the Super Giants' reach.</p>"

Dewald Brevis, Jofra Archer, Kagiso Rabada, Rassie van der Dussen and Sam Curran are also part of the set-up. The Royals, meanwhile, have appointed David Miller as their skipper. Dane Vilas, Jason Roy, Jos Buttler and former England captain Eoin Morgan make up a strong batting unit, with Lungi Ngidi and Tabraiz Shamsi providing penetration with the ball. </p><p>So, a cracking curtain-raiser awaits us, and for the entirety of this contest, I (Shashwat) am going to be your eyes and ears.

That will be a wrap from us for tonight. The action, though, comes thick and fast at the SA20. Tomorrow, the Durban Super Giants will take on Joburg Super Kings in what promises to be another cracking contest. Until next time, this is me (Shashwat) signing off on behalf of Chandan. Goodbye, goodnight, and take care!</p><p><strong>Rashid Khan, MI Cape Town captain:</strong> So happy to be starting the new competition with a win. The way we started was great, and then we finished off with our batting. Looking forward to keeping this momentum. The bowling unit we have is one of the best. As a captain it makes it so easy because you have bowlers who can bowl in different stages.  We just need to focus on doing the right things. (On Archer) It is super hard to be out for so long and come back this way. It was delightful to watch. We saw him in practice and knew that he was ready to go. It was superb to watch and to be on the same side as him. (On Brevis) The way he played tonight was amazing. We know how good a hitter he is. Important thing was he took his time today and the way he managed his innings and finished it was important. The youngsters are stepping up, they are working hard and I am super excited to be with them for the next few weeks. (On the crowd) Thanks to the crowd for supporting their home team. It is great to see the crowd back and it feels amazing to have that kind of support. </p><p><strong>David Miller, Paarl Royals captain:</strong> Not a good start from us. I think it was a little bit tough when we batted up front. It got a little easier as it went on. They batted really well and put us under pressure. Our execution was not great either. We slipped up in a few areas and we will have to learn from those areas. There were two dropped catches which is never good in a T20 competition. He (Brevis) struck it really sweet and at the back end, it was good to watch. When Morgs and I were batting, we were having that chat about how him (Archer) being fit is great for world cricket. </p><p><strong>Dewald Brevis, Player of the Match:</strong> I want to thank the crowd for their great support. I really enjoyed batting every single ball. I want to thank god as well. Absolutely grateful for this opportunity to play in front of my home crowd. He (de Villiers) has played a key role in my development as a player. He helped me through a lot and gives me the right advice. I could not wait for this day to see him (Archer), run in and bowl at pace. It is not my worry (that Livingstone and Rabada are returning), it is the other teams' worry. </p><p><strong>8:40pm</strong> Well, that was a fairly comfortable victory for MI Cape Town in the end. They set the tone with the ball, with Archer and Stone leading the way. Then, it was time for Brevis and Rickelton to take the game away from the Royals. The latter got the ball rolling in the powerplay, before Brevis took over. Even after Rickelton was dismissed, Brevis continued on his merry way, notching up a 41-ball 70, which included four fours and five sixes. Brevis' belligerence also meant that MI Cape Town hunted down the total inside 16 overs, securing a bonus point win at the first time of asking. </p><p>Plenty to ponder, meanwhile, for the Royals. Their bowling plans lacked clarity and their accuracy also left a lot to be desired. They were not great with the bat either, and might have to revaluate how best to use the power hitters in their side. There is still a long way to go, and from that perspective, they might be happy that their bad day at the office is now out of the way.</p>"
